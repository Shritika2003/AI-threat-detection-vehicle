# ðŸš— AI-Driven Threat Detection in Autonomous Vehicles

This project implements a real-time anomaly detection system using Machine Learning to detect potential cyber threats in autonomous vehicles. It uses synthetic sensor data (speed, ECU, throttle, brake) and applies the **Isolation Forest algorithm** to identify anomalies in vehicle behavior.
